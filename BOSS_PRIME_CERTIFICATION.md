## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Critical Risks: **NONE** ✅

### Medium Risks: **NONE** ✅

### Low Risks:

1. **Rate Limit Headers Not Exposed** (⚠️ Minor)
   - **Impact:** Rate limit headers not visible in API responses
   - **Mitigation:** Rate limiting is still enforced server-side
   - **Priority:** Low
   - **Action:** Add response headers in future iteration

2. **Mock Title Generation** (ℹ️ Known Limitation)
   - **Impact:** Titles are mock data, not actual LLM-generated
   - **Mitigation:** Documented as expected behavior
   - **Priority:** Medium (pending LLM integration)
   - **Action:** Replace with actual LLM API when ready

3. **Stripe Webhook Secret** (ℹ️ Configuration Pending)
   - **Impact:** Webhook signature verification will fail without secret
   - **Mitigation:** Code is correct, just needs environment variable
   - **Priority:** Medium (before processing real payments)
   - **Action:** Configure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var
