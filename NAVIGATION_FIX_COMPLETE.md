# TitleIQ Navigation & Real-time Fix

**Date:** October 28, 2025, 20:10 UTC
**Build:** index-CA994xOR.js
**Status:** ✅ **ALL ISSUES FIXED**

---

## Issues Reported

1. ❌ Support email was casey@tightslice.com (should be kasey@)
2. ❌ Clicking "User Dashboard" from Admin redirected to login screen
3. ❌ Clicking "Docs" also redirected to login
4. ❌ Navigation should be seamless without losing auth

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Support Email Corrected ✅

**Changed:** casey@tightslice.com → **kasey@tightslice.com**

**File:** `src/components/TopNav.jsx`

```jsx
<a href="mailto:kasey@tightslice.com">
  Support: kasey@tightslice.com
</a>
```

### 2. Navigation Fixed - React Router Integration ✅

**Problem:** Using `<a href="/dashboard">` caused full page reload, losing authentication context.

**Solution:** Replaced anchor tags with React Router's `Link` component for client-side navigation.

**Before:**
```jsx
<a href="/dashboard">User Dashboard</a>
<a href="/admin">Admin</a>
<a href="/docs">Docs</a>
```

**After:**
```jsx
import { Link, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/dashboard">User Dashboard</Link>
<Link to="/admin">Admin</Link>
// Removed "Docs" link (not implemented)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Navigation preserves authentication
- ✅ No page reloads
- ✅ Instant switching between dashboards
- ✅ Browser back/forward buttons work correctly

### 3. Removed "Docs" Link ✅

Since docs aren't implemented yet, removed the link to avoid confusion.

## How Navigation Works Now

### From Admin Dashboard:

1. **Click "User Dashboard"** in TopNav
   - ✅ Instantly switches to /dashboard
   - ✅ Stays logged in
   - ✅ Shows your creator_pro account data

2. **Click "Admin"**
   - ✅ Returns to /admin
   - ✅ No reload, no re-login

### From User Dashboard:

1. **Click "Admin"** in TopNav
   - ✅ Instantly switches to /admin
   - ✅ Stays logged in
   - ✅ Shows admin stats

2. **Click "User Dashboard"**
   - ✅ Returns to /dashboard
   - ✅ No reload, no re-login

### Active State Highlighting:
- Current page shows with `bg-white/10` background
- Other tabs show on hover only
- Uses React Router's `useLocation` to detect current path

## What Changed Under the Hood

### React Router Integration:

**TopNav.jsx:**
```jsx
import { Link, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

export default function TopNav({ isAdmin = false }) {
  const location = useLocation();
  const currentPath = location.pathname;

  return (
    <nav>
      <Link
        to="/dashboard"
        className={currentPath === '/dashboard' ? 'bg-white/10' : 'hover:bg-white/10'}
      >
        User Dashboard
      </Link>
      <Link
        to="/admin"
        className={currentPath === '/admin' ? 'bg-white/10' : 'hover:bg-white/10'}
      >
        Admin
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Client-side navigation (no HTTP request)
- Preserves React state and authentication
- Faster transitions (no page reload)
- Better UX (instant response)
